Is a CSS framework like Tailwind a good fit for the project?
 Frameworks typically bundle their own normalize and/or reset.


Writing CSS from scratch? Start by adding modern-normalize. 
This gives you border-box and will fix bugs, accessibility issues, 
and other undesirable behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed during development 
and end up impacting your users.


If you are going for a browser-default aesthetic, 
then you might not need a CSS reset. Otherwise seriously consider adding one, 
like the lightweight version below. It will save you a lot of repetitive styling 
in the long run. Also, it can be risky to add a CSS reset late in a project, 
so this is best decided up front.


@import "modern-normalize";

:root {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, figure, p, ol, ul {
  margin: 0;
}

ol[role="list"], ul[role="list"] {
  list-style: none;
  padding-inline: 0;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 {
  font-size: inherit;
  font-weight: inherit;
}

img {
  display: block;
  max-inline-size: 100%;
}
