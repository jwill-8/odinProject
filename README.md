This repository contains my notes, projects, scripts, and files documenting my journey through the [Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript). 

As a Data Scientist at [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/bold/), I am an advanced R developer with extensive experience in building and enhancing R Shiny applications. I find this work highly engaging and am eager to expand my skills by learning how to develop more robust web applications using React.  

The contents of this repository will serve as a record of my progress and learnings as I dive deeper into JavaScript and full-stack development.
